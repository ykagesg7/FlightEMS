# Git Commit Message Conventions

## Language: English Only

All commit messages MUST be written in **English only** (title, body, and footer).

Japanese characters in commit messages get garbled (mojibake) due to Windows PowerShell encoding issues. This has been confirmed in the project's git history.

## Format: Conventional Commits

```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body>
```

### Types
- `feat:` -- new feature or significant addition
- `fix:` -- bug fix
- `refactor:` -- code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` -- documentation changes only
- `test:` -- adding or updating tests
- `chore:` -- maintenance tasks (deps, config, CI)
- `style:` -- formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons (no logic change)
- `perf:` -- performance improvement

### Rules
- Title line: max 72 characters, imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at the end of the title
- Body: wrap at 72 characters, explain "why" not "what"
- Reference issue numbers when applicable: `fixes #123`

### Examples

```
feat: add Sentry error monitoring integration

- Configure @sentry/react with browser tracing
- Update EnhancedErrorBoundary to report errors to Sentry
- Add source map upload plugin for production builds
```

```
fix: convert MDX frontmatter from YAML to ESM export

7 lesson files used YAML frontmatter which is not supported
by the MDX parser. Convert to export const meta format.
```

```
